The goal of the thesis is to extend the axiom of Stable Priceability, first presented in the paper "Market-Based Explanations of Collective Decisions" from AAAI-2021, to the model of elections with additive utilities. The new axiom should satisfy three main objectives: be computable in polynomial time, imply being the Core up-to-one and be equivalent to classic Stable Priceability in the case of binary utilites.

The algorithm for verifying the axiom will also be implemented in the open library Pabutools and tested on existing instances of elections in order to further assess its satisfiability and its relation to other criteria considered in the literature.
